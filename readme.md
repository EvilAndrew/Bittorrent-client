# Bittorrent Client

### This project is an application that lets user download a file from peer-to-peer network if .torrent file is provided

### The project is based on *asyncio* asynchronous Python library, because the application implies multiple IO interactions (e.g., interaction through network or file IO). To not stop the whole application while waiting for a peer's response, *asyncio* is used

### To run the project, *python main.py <path_to_the_.torrent_file>* console command should be entered

<br />
